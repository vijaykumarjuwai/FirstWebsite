Image Replacement: When using an image as a logo it is important to also have plan HTML text available for a screen reader or if the image wont display-but generally want this HTML text to remain hidden because it is visually unattractive. This is dont by including the label in the HTML but in the CSS having a huge "text-indent" which will shift the image out of the view of the user.

	Text-indent hides the placeholder text: 

	*HTML*
	<a href="#" class="logo">Sven's Snowshoe Emporium </a>

	*CSS*

	.logo {
 		background: url(logo.png);
 		display: block;
 		height: 100px;
 		width: 200px;
 		text-indent: -9999px;
	}

Sprites: *When you have the image change when you hover over it. This is best done by having 2 images simultaneously loaded 1 above othe other, then simply shifting the display down to reveal the different image once the hover is happening. The total height of the new image is 200% the height of each individual image.

Let's combine the images into one file:

Using background-position:

	*CSS*

	.logo {
		 background: url(logo.png);
		 display: block;
		 height: 100px;
		 width: 200px;
		 text-indent: -9999px;
	}
	.logo:hover, .logo:focus {
		background-position: 0 -100px;
	}
		*With the background position applied the orientation does not shift on the X-axis (0) the Y-axis shifts down 100px (-100px)

	Multiple images: Here we can have 2 images loaded simultaneoulsy for display	

		*CSS*
		.twitter, .github {
			 background: url(social.png);
			 display: block;
			 height: 100px;
			 width: 100px;
			 text-indent: -9999px;
		}
		.github {
 			background-position: -100px 0;
		}

		*Here we have the 2 different logos in a single image. the twitter logo is displayyed at the basic background-position of 0,0 the .github image is simply the same background image but the display is shifted 100px to the Right on the X-axis.


	Multiple images & states: Here we can have 4 images loaded simultaneously for display.

		*CSS*
		.twitter:hover, .twitter:focus {
		 background-position: 0 -100px;
		}
		.github:hover, .github:focus {
		 background-position: -100px -100px;
		}

		We can include shifting downward as well allowing for a total of 4 displays to be shown through a single image.
