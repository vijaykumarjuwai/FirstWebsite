CSS Rules

ID (#Gallery) will overide class (.gallery) and class will overide tag (body)

IDs are sometimes used in javascript.

HTML is markup language so it formats how a page looks, but it does not make any programs.
CSS styles sheets, it defines how something looks.
Javascript is a pure programming language & it is used for websites.
	w3school has lots of info on javascript.

	2/25

Property of box-sizing: value is border-box. This will stop the box from changing size when you adjust the padding. This locks the size of the box.

auto vs. 100%: THe difference only matters with images.

100% means its  takes up the full image size.

auto will take up as much as available
it will still need to be cropped.

Github notes:

	git add . will select everything new in a folder
	git add index.html will only select 'index.html'

	git commit -m "message" will push the content inside the pseudo-box but it is not actually there & will ask for a message to let other users know what you have updated.

	git push -u origin master this will take the comit data and push it into github

background is efficient but not flexible for images.

look up whole page background image css-use a property called cover but look it up.

look at the website can I use. com to see what browsers support a given property
