New Input Types in HTML 5

		HTML5 provides several new input types:
			๏ Search
			๏ Email
			๏ URL
			๏ Tel
			๏ Number
			๏ Range
			๏ Month
			๏ Week
			๏ Time
			๏ Datetime
			๏ Datetime-local 
			๏ Color
			๏ Date

		If a browser doesn’t support the input type, it defaults to “text.”


	Search: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "search" represents a one-line plain-text edit control for entering one or more search terms.

		<input type="search" />

	Email: The email input looks just like a regular text input, but with added usability on mobile devices.

		<input type="email" />

	URL: The url input looks just like a regular text input, but with added usability on mobile devices.		

			<input type="url" />

	Date: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "date" represents a control for setting the element’s value to a string representing a date.	

		 <input type="date" />

	Tel: Again, the tel input looks just like a regular text input, but with added usability on mobile devices.

		<input type="tel" />

	Number: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "number" represents a precise control for setting the element’s value to a string representing a number.

		<input type="number" />

	Range: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "range" represents an imprecise control for setting the element’s value to a string representing a number.

		 <input type="range" />

	Month, Week:

		<input type="month" />
		<input type="week" />	

	Time, Datetime-Local: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "datetime-local" represents a control for setting the element’s value to a string representing a local date and time (with no timezone information).

		<input type="time" />
		<input type="datetime-local" />	 

	Color: The input element with a type attribute whose value is "color" represents a color-well control, for setting the element’s value to a string representing a simple color.	

		<input type="color" />	

New Form Elements:

	HTML5 provides new form elements:
		Datalist 
		Keygen 
		Output	

	Datalist: The datalist element represents a set of option elements that represent predefined options for other controls.
	
		<input type="text" list="browsers" />

		<input type="text" list="browsers" />	*NOTE* the list= & the datalist id= need to match for this to run 
		<datalist id="browsers"> 					   properly.
			  <option value="Chrome">
			  <option value="Firefox">
			  <option value="Internet Explorer">
			  <option value="Opera">
			  <option value="Safari">
		</datalist>	

			Here the option values are what is available to the input.

New Form Attributes: 

	HTML5 provides several new form attributes: [This training will focus on Placeholder, Autofocus, Aequired, & Pattern]
		๏ Placeholder
		๏ Autofocus
		๏ Autocomplete ๏ Required
		๏ Pattern
		๏ List
		๏ Multiple
		๏ novalidate
		๏ formnovalidate ๏ form
		๏ formaction
		๏ formenctype
		๏ formmethod
		๏ formtarget

		Placeholder: The placeholder attribute allows you to specify a message that is shown inside the input, hidden when the user starts typing, and then returns when focus is lost on the input (when the input is blank)

			Example usage of placeholder attribute: <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your email..." />

		Autofocus: The autofocus attribute will automatically focus the specified input when the page is rendered.
			<input type="text" autofocus />

		Required: If you add the new HTML5 required attribute to an input, when the form is submitted, the user will be notified of an error if the field is left blank.
			<input type="text" required />

		Pattern: The pattern attribute accepts a JavaScript regular expression that can be used to validate a form field to match the pattern.
			<input type="text" pattern="[0-9]{3}" /> *Here we are saying we want the pattern to be 3 0-9 digits.*
