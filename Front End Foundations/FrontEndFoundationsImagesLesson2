Floating Images are having images next to multiple block level tags

The float property lets an inline tags tag up some of the space that block-level tags usually take up.

	To Do, put the img, h3, and p all in one li and float the img left.

	*HTML*
	<ul class="recipes">
		<li>
			<img src=...> 
			<h3><a href=...>Magic Cake</a></h3> 
			<p>...</p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul>

	 *CSS*

	 .recipes img{
	 	float: left;
	 }

	 This makes the image take up some of the left space that the h3 and p boxes would normally eat up as block-level tags.

	 Success! We’ve also added some right padding so the image doesn’t touch right up against the text.

	  .recipes img{
	 	float: left;
	 	padding-right: 10px;
	 }
