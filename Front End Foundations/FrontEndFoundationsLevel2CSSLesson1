CSS: Cascading Style Sheets: CSS is code that changes the appearance of HTML.
	CSS are defined using selectors. 
		Selectors selects HTML tags and then alter the HTML tag to change how the HTML looks. 
			The simpliest way to select a tag is to write the name of a tag without the angle brackets.

	selectors {
		property: value;
	}

		Example: 
		p {
			text-decoration: underline;
			color: red;
		}
			Here the "selector: is p, the first "property" is "text-decoration", the "value" of the "text-decoration" is "underline." The 2nd "property" is "color," the "value" of the "color" is "red"

			Note: It is possible to have multiple properties applied to a single selector.

			Selectors will select all matching tags on the page and apply properties. 

		Example: 
		p {
			text-decoration: underline;
			color: red;
		}
		
		So in this case in the html all "p" will have this these values.	

	A descendent selector can be used to select tags only if they are children of another tag.

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>1 pound of sugar</li>
			<li>3 sticks of butter</li>
		</ul>
		
		ul li {
			font-size: 24px;
		}	

		In this example, this selector will only apply to li tags that are children of ul tags

		TIP: read the selector list from right-to-left. The left-most selector is the parent, with children following to the right. 

	A pseudo-selector is a modifier that can be added to a selector to select a tag only when a certain condition has occurred.	pseudo-selectors modify HTML based on an action or behavior.

		a {
			text-decoration: none;
		}	
			*Removes the underline from all links on a page*

		a:hover {
			text-decoration: underline;
			color: darkred;
		}	
			*Adds an underline and changes the color of all links on a page ONLY when the mouse is over the link*

	The :first-child pseudo-selector can be applied to narrow the amount of child tags selected		
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>1 pound of sugar</li>
			<li>3 sticks of butter</li>
		</ol>

		ol li:first-child {
			color: red;
		}
			*This will select only the 1st li tag*

Where do we put CSS stuff?
	One place you can put CSS is in a style tag thatâ€™s a child of the head tag.

		<html>
			<head>
				<style type="text/css">
					a {
						color:red;
					}
				</style>
					*The <style type> lets the browser know that CSS is coming*
