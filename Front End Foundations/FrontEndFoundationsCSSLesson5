div is short for division, and it’s a block-level tag that’s a generic way to group related content into sections on a page.

	<body>
		<div>
			<h1>Recipe World</h1>
			<ul class="nav">
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Magic Cake</h2>	
		</div>
	</body>

A common way to differentiate between <div> tags is to add a class.		

	<body>
		<div class="header">
			<h1>Recipe World</h1>
			<ul class="nav">
		</div>
		<div class="main-content">
			<h2>Magic Cake</h2>	
		</div>
	</body>

Classes will let use style each <div> differently

In CSS we can now apply styles to each new <div>-Thus we can create style consistently across categories or divisions of content.

	.header {
		padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
		background-color: #b56663
	}

	.header a {
		color: #ffffff;
	}

	h1 {
		color: #ffffff;
	}

There’s two main ways to center things, but the CSS you write depends
on what you’re centering.

		Centering 1:
	If: you want to center an entire block-level tag

	And: it is fixed-width

	Then: set the left and right margins to auto	

		.main-content{
		width: 500px;
		padding: 20px;
		border: 1px solid #dddddd;
		margin: 30px auto 0 auto
		}	

auto here means take as much space as you can.

		Centering 2:
	If: you want to center children inside a block-level tag

	Then: set the text-align of the children to center	

	h1 {
		color: #ffffff;
		margin: 0 0 15px 0;
		text-align: center;
	}
