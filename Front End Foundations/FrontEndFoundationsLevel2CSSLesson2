A popular way to choose colors in CSS is to use hexadecimal numbers.
	p{
		color: red;
		color: #FF0000;

		color: black;
		color: #000000

		color: yellow;
		color: #FFFF00
	}

	*Hexadecimal colors have 3 different parts: The 1st 2 # set the amount of red, the 2nd 2 # st the amount of green, the 3rd 2 # set the amount of blue.*

	*Color values for red, green, and blue run from 0 - 255 decimal, or 00 - FF hexadecimal.*

	Hexadecimal numbers run from 0-15, but use letters for numbers above 9.
 		A = 10 C = 12 B = 11 D = 13 E = 14 F = 15

 	This is a Hexadecimal system (meaning base 16). For example 74 in hexadecimal system is equivalent in base 10 to 7*16+4*1=128

 	So for example the color #7403AB =
 		Red: (7*16) + (4*1)= 116
 		Green: (0*16) + (3*1)= 3
 		Blue: (10*16) + (11*1)= 171
 	So this color is some red, almost no green, and more blue than red.
 	Thatâ€™s a color that looks Purple
