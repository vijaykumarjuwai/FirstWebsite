Fonts and font styles can be controlled with CSS.

The font-family property is used to set the ideal font and a few fallback options.


*CSS*
body {
font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
   }

In this, the 1st font (Helvetica) is the ideal font & the other fonts are backups which will be loaded if the 1st font fails to load.

*CSS*
body {
font-family: Helvetica, Arial, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
   }

    Note that multi-word fonts must be put in quotes.

Browsers have default font settings so its important to clear all defaults at the beginning of CSS.

*CSS*
html, body, h1, h2, h3, p, ol, ul, li, a{
	padding: 0;
	border: 0;
	margin: 0;
	font-size: 100%;
	font-inherit;
}    

This will clear as presets regarding fonts

Font size is set with the font-size property.

	h2 {
		font-size: 26px

	}

	Font sizes can be set with pixels, percentages and ems.

Font thickness is set with the font-weight property.

	h2 {
		font-size: 26px

}

	Font Weight Values: normal, bold, lighter, bolder, or #values 100, 200 . . . 900

Font-style property sets italics.

Text-transform turns the text upper and lower case.

Line-height is like a margin for each line in a box. It adjusts the spaces between lines in a given box of text.

.main-content p{
	line-height: 26px;
}
