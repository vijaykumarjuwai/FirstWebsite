Justification and Order
	Changing the Order of Items with CSS

	Display position can be changed with CSS
		Order is used to determine the order of flex items along the main axis. It defaults to 0 and accepts positive & negative #s.

		Every item in a flex-box has a default position value of 0, when it has a value of 0 it displays in its source order.

*HTML*
	<nav>
		<a class="nav-brand"> 
		<a class="nav-clues"> 
		<a class="nav-suspects"> 
	</nav>	

*CSS*
	.nav-clues {
	order: -1;
	}	

	Setting .nav-clues to have an order value of -1 makes .nav-clues display before all items with their default order value of 0. 
		When this is in row something with a value of -1 will display to the left of all items with an order value of 0

		When this is in column something with a value of -1 will display below all the items with an order value of 0.


		Using a negative # displays an item first, based on the "flex-direction."

		Order changes the position of items along the main axis of the column.
