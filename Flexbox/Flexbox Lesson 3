Justification & Order: Distributing Space Along Flex LInes

	Flex Items are Distributed Along Axes
		The main axis is determined by the "flex-direction"

		Using flex-direction: lets you decide whether the flex-box functions verticly or horizontally.

	Justify-content
		used to distributed space on the main axis, the default value is "flex-start"and it accepts: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around.

		NOTE to specify exactly how much space exists between each item, non-flexbox CSS needs to be used-as flexbox will simply use its algorithm to deterine how much space to give.

	Adding Space With Non-flexbox CSS
		Margin & padding can be applied to flex items. this can be used to change the spacing in flexbox items.

	Justifying Content in a column. The main axis runs verticly, so the start point is at the top of the column, the end is at the bottom of a column.
		Main elements for layout are flex items with the column direction.
