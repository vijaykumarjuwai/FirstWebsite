Aligning Alibis
	Distributing Space Between Items

	Flex items are also aligned along a cross axis which is perpendicular to the main axis. So in the COLUMN direction, the cross-axis is horizontal and in the RROWow Direction, the cross axis is horizontal.

	The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

		In the column direction, the main axis is verticle, and the cross axis is horizontal.

		In the row direction, the main axis is horizontal, and the cross axis is vertical.

		Align-items
			Used to align content on the cross axis, the default value is stretch and it accepts: stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center, and baseline.

			Align-items: stretch fills available space.

		Flex-Start is where the cross-axis meets the main-axis.
		
		Flex-End is where the cross-axis is furtherest from the main-axis.

		Baseline & Center
			Align-items: baseline; pushs items as far away form the main-axis as possible

			Align-items: center: puts items in the middle of the cross-axis

		Align-items: center; items are centered on the cross-axis
