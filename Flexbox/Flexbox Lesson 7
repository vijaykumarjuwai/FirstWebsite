Sizing Up the Properties
	New Property for Setting Width Values.

	In order to make a 2 column layout we need to set consistent widths.

	Flex-basis property: specifies the initial size of the flex-item. Before any available space is distributed according to the flex factors. This basically sets the original size of a flex item: can be defined as %, px, em, rem etc. 

	when you use pixels the size is fixed it will not grow or shrink. If you use %/ems it will adjust to the size of its container.

	A challenge with flex-items is setting defined widths for flex-items.

	flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of a flex item. It defaults auto & current supports CSS units: %, px, em, rem etc.

	Combining flex-basis & flex-shrink:
		With one item set to pixel-based value, the other will adjust to fill the remaining space.

	Using flex-basis & absolute units.
		Items with flex-baiss that is an absolute unit will not grow beyond the value by default.

		Items with a relative flex-basis will grow to fill the space.
