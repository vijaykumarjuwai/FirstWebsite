Sizing Up the Properties
	New Properties for Space-based Size.

	Examples, Sized with Flex Properties

	flex-grow: used to specify the ratio of the space an item should fill in the main axis. It accepts #s and the default is 0.

	Using flex-grow for a Single Item.
		Assigning a value of 1 makes an item fill as much space as possible.

		Assigning a value of 1 to multiple properties will have them all try to fill as much space as possible.

	Using flex-grow with Empty Containers
		Empty flex containers will divide the space according to the ratio.

	Using flex-grow with Same-sized content:
		Content alters how the algorithm divides space.

	Using flex-grow With Uneven Content
		Content with different widths will affect the ratio size.

	PROBLEM: We want to resize the text item, but not the image.
	
	Flex-shrink: used to specify the "shrink factor" of a flex item. It accepts #s and the default is 1.

	flex-shrink: 0 in action.

		The .clue-img div remains the same size.
